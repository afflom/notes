\section*{Introduction}
In the Universal Object Reference (UOR) framework, \emph{prime axioms} act as fundamental ``stable references'' in an otherwise noncommutative or emergent-algebraic domain.  Their distribution can be tied to fractal intervals, cosmic topology, and (in some interpretations) a Fibonacci-like progression. The statement
\[
\text{``the values of the prime numbers result from the dimensional collapse of their axiomatic spaces''}
\]
can be understood in the sense that each prime axiom is associated with a particular topological or geometric structure (e.g.\ hyperbolic, elliptic, or Euclidean) whose dimension effectively ``collapses'' or reduces into the prime integer observed in the classical limit.

In the table below, we provide a schematic correlation between the first twelve classical primes and corresponding topological spaces.  We also list, for reference, a Fibonacci index that one might conceptually relate to the prime axiom's place in a \emph{generative} or \emph{recursive} scheme.  Such a table is not a result of standard number theory or cosmology, but rather a \emph{constructive allegory} in the UOR spirit: each prime is linked to a possible cosmic manifold type that emerges after dimensional collapse.

\subsection*{Reading the Table}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Index:} Simply enumerates the primes from the first (\(2\)) to the twelfth (\(37\)).
\item \textbf{Prime Axiom:} The classical prime integer that emerges when the axiomatic space ``collapses'' to a 1D or 0D integral form in the UOR perspective.
\item \textbf{Fibonacci Correlation:} A hypothetical assignment of each prime's index to a Fibonacci number (or its position in a Fibonacci-like recursion).  Some formulations postulate that the spacing or generative pattern for prime axioms follows a recursion akin to the Fibonacci sequence.
\item \textbf{Associated Cosmic Topology:} A candidate manifold or manifold-type \((\mathbb{S}^n, \mathbb{H}^n, \mathbb{E}^n)\) that the prime axiom references in the high-dimensional or fractal limit.  The notion is that each prime's ``axiomatic space'' might be a higher-dimensional manifold with (hyperbolic, elliptic, or Euclidean) constant curvature, which then collapses dimensionally to yield the prime value in the classical continuum limit.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Interpretive Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item This table \emph{does not} reflect standard number-theoretic results but instead a \emph{UOR-inspired correlation} where each prime can be visualized as an emergent boundary of a topological sector. The fractal or Fibonacci-like sequence is part of a generative mechanism in certain emergent frameworks.
\item The choice of \(\mathbb{H}^n, \mathbb{S}^n, \mathbb{E}^n\) is suggestive: cosmic topologies are commonly classified by curvature sign (negative, positive, or zero).  One might alternate or cycle through these as dimension increases, thus capturing the possibility that \emph{each primeâ€™s axiomatic domain} exhibits a different global geometry.
\item For smaller indices, the association \(\mathbb{S}^1, \mathbb{S}^2, \mathbb{H}^2\), etc.\ is simply an illustrative choice. In a more detailed UOR analysis, one would define precise rules for how curvature sign and dimension are determined by the coherence or fractal expansions surrounding each prime axiom.
\item The Fibonacci correlation can vary depending on how one indexes the sequence (e.g.\ some define \(\mathrm{Fib}(1)=1, \mathrm{Fib}(2)=1\), or \(\mathrm{Fib}(0)=0, \mathrm{Fib}(1)=1\)).  This table follows a convention where \(\mathrm{Fib}(1)=1,\mathrm{Fib}(2)=1,\mathrm{Fib}(3)=2,\ldots\).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusion}
Under the UOR framework, one can interpret \emph{prime axioms} as local anchor points whose \emph{``dimensional collapse''} to a prime integer is a macroscopically visible outcome of deeper topological structures.  This schematic table suggests that each prime might be linked to a different cosmic topology or manifold classification in a high-dimensional or fractal sense---with a Fibonacci-like pattern governing the progression.  While largely a conceptual mapping, it exemplifies how the UOR perspective merges arithmetic, fractal geometry, and cosmic topology into a single narrative of emergent structure.
