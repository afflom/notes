\section{Introduction}
This document establishes a self-contained, axiomatic foundation for the Prime Framework, a system in which geometry, algebra, and symmetry are fused so that classical number theory emerges from first principles. The framework is built on four core axioms:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A smooth reference manifold \(M\) that provides the geometric arena.
  \item An attached fiber algebra \(C_x\) (typically a Clifford algebra) at each point \(x\in M\) that encodes local algebraic data.
  \item A symmetry group \(G\) acting by isometries on \(M\) (and lifting to each \(C_x\)), ensuring that local descriptions are consistent under transformations.
  \item A coherence inner product on each \(C_x\) that forces any multiple representations of an abstract object (e.g., a number) to ``cohere'' to a unique, minimal-norm embedding.
\end{enumerate}
We now present the Prime Axioms and provide a self-contained proof that these axioms yield a consistent foundation in which every abstract object, such as a natural number, admits a unique canonical embedding.

\section{The Prime Axioms}

\begin{axiom}[Reference Manifold]
There exists a smooth, connected, and orientable manifold \(M\) equipped with a nondegenerate metric tensor \(g\). That is, \((M, g)\) is a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold that serves as the universal geometric arena for all objects in the framework.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[Algebraic Fibers]
For each point \(x \in M\), there exists an associative algebra \(C_x\), typically taken to be the Clifford algebra
\[
C_x := \mathrm{Cl}(T_xM, g_x),
\]
where \(T_xM\) is the tangent space at \(x\) and \(g_x\) is the quadratic form induced by \(g\). The defining relation in \(C_x\) is
\[
v \cdot w + w \cdot v = 2\,g_x(v,w)\,1, \quad \forall v, w \in T_xM.
\]
This fiber algebra encodes the local algebraic structure at \(x\).
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[Symmetry Group Action]
There exists a Lie group \(G\) that acts smoothly on \(M\) by isometries; that is, for every \(h \in G\) and \(x \in M\), the transformation \(h \cdot x\) preserves the metric \(g\). Moreover, this action lifts to each fiber \(C_x\) via algebra automorphisms. Explicitly, for each \(h \in G\) and \(x \in M\) there exists an isomorphism
\[
\Phi(h)_x : C_x \to C_{h\cdot x},
\]
which preserves the algebraic structure. This axiom guarantees that local representations are consistent under changes of reference frame.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[Coherence Inner Product]
Each fiber algebra \(C_x\) is endowed with a positive-definite inner product \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_c\) that is invariant under the action of \(G\). This inner product induces a norm \(\|a\|_c = \sqrt{\langle a, a \rangle_c}\) for every \(a \in C_x\). The coherence inner product is defined so that if an abstract object (such as a number) is represented in multiple ways within \(C_x\), any discrepancy among these representations increases the norm. Thus, the unique minimal-norm element represents the fully coherent, canonical embedding of the object.
\end{axiom}

\section{A Self-Contained Proof of the Axiomatic Foundation}

\begin{theorem}[Consistency and Uniqueness of Canonical Representations]
Under Axioms 1--4, every abstract object (in particular, every natural number) that is encoded in the fiber algebra \(C_x\) admits a unique canonical representation as the minimal-norm element, up to the action of \(G\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let \(N\) be an abstract natural number to be embedded within the framework. For each point \(x \in M\), suppose there exists a set \(S_N \subset C_x\) of all elements \(a_x\) that encode \(N\) (via a multi-base expansion, for example). These elements satisfy a system of linear constraints ensuring that the different graded components of \(a_x\) correspond to the various base representations of \(N\).

By Axiom 4, the inner product \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_c\) on \(C_x\) is positive definite, which implies that the norm \(\|a_x\|_c\) is strictly convex. Hence, the function
\[
f : S_N \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}, \quad f(a_x) = \|a_x\|_c,
\]
attains a unique minimum in the finite-dimensional space \(C_x\). Denote this unique minimal-norm element by \(\hat{N}_x\).

Now, consider two different points \(x, y \in M\) with corresponding minimal representations \(\hat{N}_x \in C_x\) and \(\hat{N}_y \in C_y\). By Axiom 3, there exists an element \(h \in G\) such that \(h \cdot x = y\), and the corresponding isomorphism \(\Phi(h)_x\) satisfies
\[
\|\Phi(h)_x(\hat{N}_x)\|_c = \|\hat{N}_x\|_c.
\]
Since both \(\Phi(h)_x(\hat{N}_x)\) and \(\hat{N}_y\) are minimal representations of \(N\) in \(C_y\), the uniqueness on \(C_y\) implies
\[
\Phi(h)_x(\hat{N}_x) = \hat{N}_y.
\]
Thus, the canonical representation of \(N\) is unique up to the action of \(G\).

This completes the proof that the axioms yield a consistent and self-contained foundation in which every abstract object (such as a natural number) has a unique, coherent, and canonical embedding.
\end{proof}

\section{Conclusion}
The Prime Axioms—comprising a smooth reference manifold \(M\), local fiber algebras \(C_x\) (typically Clifford algebras), a symmetry group \(G\) acting by isometries, and a coherence inner product—together form a unified foundation for the Prime Framework. We have shown that these axioms provide an environment in which the embedding of abstract objects (like numbers) is uniquely determined by minimal-norm conditions. This self-contained axiomatic basis not only supports the emergence of classical number theory but also paves the way for further derivations, such as unique factorization and the analytic properties of primes, all from first principles.
