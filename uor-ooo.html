      <h2>1. Quadruple Object Definition in UOR</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Object-Oriented Ontology (OOO) Quadruple:</strong> In Graham Harman's OOO, each object has four fundamental <em>poles</em> or aspects:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Real Object (RO):</strong> the object’s inaccessible essence or withdrawn core (independent of any particular relation or observation).</li>
        <li><strong>Sensual Object (SO):</strong> the object as it appears phenomenally or in experience -- a <em>vantage-dependent</em> appearance of the object.</li>
        <li><strong>Real Qualities (RQ):</strong> the qualities or features belonging to the object’s essence (RO) -- these are inherent properties that persist in the object, though not fully accessible in any single encounter.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensual Qualities (SQ):</strong> the qualities that appear or fluctuate in specific relational or observational conditions -- the features of the object <em>as experienced</em> in a given interaction or context.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These four components interrelate without collapsing into one; the real object never becomes fully transparent through its sensual presentations. We seek to <em>formalize</em> this quadruple within the <em>Universal Object Reference (UOR)</em> framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>UOR Framework Primitives:</strong> UOR posits that all definable objects can be represented inside a unital <em>$*$-algebra</em> $A$ (for concreteness, one may imagine a finite-dimensional Clifford algebra or matrix algebra). Key UOR primitives include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Idempotent elements</em> (projections) to represent fundamental object “seeds” or identities. An element $p\in A$ is <em>idempotent</em> if $p^2 = p$. Stable idempotents that cannot be broken by small perturbations correspond to irreducible object cores.</li>
        <li><em>Noncommutativity:</em> In general, not all elements of $A$ commute ($xy \neq yx$). This models the idea that objects cannot be fully transparent or reducible to each other. Commutator brackets $[x,y]=xy - yx$ measure the failure to commute.</li>
        <li><em>Subalgebras and Projections:</em> A subalgebra $B \subseteq A$ can represent a particular <em>vantage point</em> or context. Projection operators in $B$ can single out what part of an object is visible in that context.</li>
        <li><em>Transformations (Symmetries):</em> The algebra may have internal symmetries (e.g. gauge group actions) that rearrange components without changing fundamental identities.</li>
        <li><em>Base-$b$ expansions:</em> In some UOR models, elements have expansions in a “digital” basis which can tune the granularity of state representations. A larger base $b$ yields finer detail (more potential overlap between object and appearance), whereas a smaller $b$ coarsens distinctions (increasing orthogonality between real and sensual aspects).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Using these primitives, we define the <strong>quadruple object</strong> in $A$:
      </p>
      
      <div class="definition">
        <h3>Definition 1 (Quadruple Object in UOR)</h3>
        <p>
          Let $A$ be a unital $*$-algebra (with unit $1\in A$). A <em>quadruple object</em> is a 4-tuple 
          $$ Q = (\mathrm{RO}, \mathrm{SO}, \mathrm{RQ}, \mathrm{SQ}) \in A^4, $$
          satisfying:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Real Object ($RO$):</strong> $RO$ is a <em>stable idempotent</em> in $A$ (so $RO^2 = RO$) which does <em>not</em> commute with many elements of $A$. In particular, $RO$ has significant noncommutativity with the surrounding algebra, capturing its “withdrawn” essence. Equivalently, there exist elements $X\in A$ (especially those representing other objects or observations) such that $[RO, X] \neq 0$.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sensual Object ($SO$):</strong> $SO$ is an idempotent (or a projection-like element) belonging to a subalgebra $B \subseteq A$ that represents a particular <em>phenomenal domain or vantage</em>. We can think of $SO$ as the identity element of the object’s appearance within that sub-context. $SO$ is idempotent ($SO^2 = SO$) and represents a <em>partial overlap</em> with $RO$, i.e., $RO \cdot SO$ may be nonzero, indicating that the real object is not entirely disjoint from its appearance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Real Qualities ($RQ$):</strong> $RQ$ is an element (or set of elements) representing the <em>real qualities</em> of the object. Formally, $RQ$ lies in (or generates) the <em>commutant</em> of $RO$ (the subalgebra of $A$ commuting with $RO$) – at least partially – meaning 
            $$ RO\,RQ = RQ\,RO. $$
            These qualities pertain to $RO$’s intrinsic features. However, $RQ$ generally does <em>not</em> commute with $SO$, since those intrinsic features need not fully manifest in a given phenomenal subalgebra.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sensual Qualities ($SQ$):</strong> $SQ$ represents qualities that arise <em>within the sensual domain</em>; $SQ \in B$ (the same subalgebra as $SO$) and encodes the properties that the object exhibits in that vantage. Typically, $SQ$ does <em>not</em> commute with $RO$, reflecting that these observable qualities are not part of the object’s hidden essence but rather surface in relation to the context. $SQ$ may or may not commute with $SO$.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        This definition provides a rigorous mapping from the philosophical OOO components to algebraic <em>UOR primitives</em>: an object’s <em>identity</em> is an idempotent ($RO$) in the algebra, its <em>appearance</em> is another idempotent ($SO$) in a subalgebra, and the interplay of <em>qualities</em> is captured by commutation relations (or lack thereof) with these idempotents. The requirement that $RO$ be noncommutative with many elements encodes the <em>irreducible core</em> of the object, while the overlap $RO\,SO$ encodes how much of the real object is revealed in a given perspective.
      </p>
      
      <div class="remark">
        <strong>Remark 1 (Overlap and Transparency):</strong> If $RO$ and $SO$ are <em>orthogonal</em> idempotents ($RO\,SO = 0$), then $RO$’s entire essence is invisible in the $SO$-vantage – the object does not manifest at all in that context. Conversely, if $RO\,SO \neq 0$, there is a partial revelation: $RO\,SO$ (which is itself an element of $A$) can be interpreted as the <em>portion</em> of the real object present in the sensual domain. One can quantify the degree of overlap by a trace or norm; for example, $\mathrm{Tr}(RO\,SO)$ or $\|RO\,SO\|$. If this measure is zero, $RO$ is fully “withdrawn” from that vantage; if positive, some aspect of $RO$ is accessible. In particular, $\mathrm{Tr}(RO\,SO) = 0$ if and only if $RO\,SO=0$, whereas a larger $\mathrm{Tr}(RO\,SO)$ indicates a greater immanent presence of the real object.
      </div>
      
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example 1 (Matrix Realization of a Quadruple):</strong>
        <p>
          To concretely verify this structure, consider 
          $$ A = M_4(\mathbb{R}), $$
          the algebra of $4\times4$ real matrices (a simple Clifford algebra example). Define:
        </p>
        <p>
          $$ RO = \mathrm{diag}(1,1,0,0), $$
          which is an idempotent projecting onto a 2-dimensional subspace (the “real core”).
        </p>
        <p>
          $$ SO = \mathrm{diag}(1,0,1,0), $$
          an idempotent projecting onto a different 2-dimensional subspace (the “phenomenal domain”).
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, 
          $$ RO\,SO = \mathrm{diag}(1,0,0,0), $$
          which is nonzero, indicating partial overlap (specifically, one dimension of the real core is visible in the $SO$ domain). Note that if 
          $$ SO = \mathrm{diag}(0,0,1,1) $$
          instead (completely orthogonal to $RO$), then $RO\,SO=0$, indicating no overlap.
        </p>
        <p>
          We could further choose 
          $$ RQ = \mathrm{diag}(a,a,d,d) \quad \text{with } a\neq d, $$
          which commutes with $RO$ (since $RO$ is diagonal with entries $1,1,0,0$) but not with $SO$. And $SQ$ can be chosen in the subalgebra $B$ (spanned by matrices that act nontrivially only on the subspace for which $SO=1$) that does not commute with $RO$; one simple choice is 
          $$ SQ = E_{1,3}+E_{3,1}, $$
          which swaps a basis element in $RO$’s subspace with one outside. This explicit example illustrates that all conditions of Definition 1 hold, confirming that the quadruple object structure is consistent and realizable in a concrete algebra.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="remark">
        <strong>Remark 2 (Gauge Symmetries and Qualities):</strong> In many cases, the algebra $A$ may factor in symmetries (e.g., internal symmetries in physics). For instance, $A$ could include a direct product of matrix algebras or group algebras (such as 
        $$ A \cong M_n(\mathbb{C}) \otimes \mathbb{C}[G] $$
        for some symmetry group $G$). A transformation (automorphism) in the symmetry part can be thought of as a <em>gauge transformation</em> that leaves $RO$ fixed but changes how $SQ$ appears. Real qualities $RQ$ tend to correspond to <em>invariants</em> under these symmetries (e.g., conserved quantities), whereas sensual qualities $SQ$ transform under the symmetry (yielding different gauge frames). The formalism above guarantees that such symmetries do not break the quadruple structure.

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <section id="section2">
      <h2>2. Quaternionic Representation of the Quadruple (Investigation)</h2>
      <p>
        The number <em>four</em> in the quadruple object invites comparison with the 4-dimensional algebra of <em>quaternions</em> $\mathbb{H}$ (which has a basis $\{1, \mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k}\}$). Quaternions are a noncommutative division algebra over $\mathbb{R}$, and they have one real unit ($1$) and three imaginary units ($\mathbf{i},\mathbf{j},\mathbf{k}$) with multiplication rules 
        $$ \mathbf{i}^2=\mathbf{j}^2=\mathbf{k}^2=\mathbf{i}\mathbf{j}\mathbf{k}=-1. $$
      </p>
      <p>
        Superficially, one might attempt to map:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>$RO$ (real object) $\sim$ the scalar part of a quaternion,</li>
        <li>$SO, RQ, SQ$ $\sim$ the three imaginary components.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, note:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In our formalism, $RO$ is an idempotent ($RO^2 = RO$). In a division algebra like $\mathbb{H}$, the only idempotent elements are trivial (0 or 1). Nontrivial idempotents (other than 0 or 1) do not exist, hence a nontrivial $RO$ cannot be modeled in $\mathbb{H}$.</li>
        <li>If we were to represent $RO$ as the identity element $1$, then it would commute with all elements of $\mathbb{H}$, contradicting the intended property of withdrawal.</li>
        <li>If we represent $RO$ as an imaginary unit (say, $\mathbf{i}$), then $RO$ would not be idempotent (since $\mathbf{i}^2=-1$).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Thus, a direct representation of the OOO quadruple object within the quaternion division algebra $\mathbb{H}$ is not possible without trivializing $RO$.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resolution:</strong> One can instead embed the quadruple object into a <em>matrix representation</em> of quaternions, or equivalently, into a <em>quaternionic-like algebra</em> that is not a division ring. For example, consider the algebra 
        $$ M_2(\mathbb{C}), $$
        which is isomorphic to a complexified quaternion algebra. In $M_2(\mathbb{C})$, nontrivial idempotents exist. One can set:
      </p>
      <p>
        $$ RO = \frac{1}{2}(I + \sigma_z) = \begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}, $$
        which is a nontrivial idempotent and serves as the real object. Similarly, choose:
      </p>
      <p>
        $$ SO = \frac{1}{2}(I + \sigma_x) = \begin{pmatrix}0.5&0.5\\0.5&0.5\end{pmatrix}, $$
        which is an idempotent in a subalgebra representing a specific observational basis. Here, $RO$ and $SO$ do not commute, providing the desired partial overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, one may choose
        $$ RQ = \frac{1}{2}(I - \sigma_z) = \begin{pmatrix}0&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix}, \quad \text{and} \quad SQ = \sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}. $$
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the isomorphism from $M_2(\mathbb{C})$ to a quaternionic algebra (via the Pauli matrices mapping to quaternion units), the quadruple object is represented in a quaternionic-like setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The OOO quadruple object cannot be directly realized inside the quaternion division algebra $\mathbb{H}$, but it can be modeled in a <em>matrix quaternion algebra</em> (or an appropriate Clifford algebra) where nontrivial idempotents exist. In such a representation, the quadruple $(RO, SO, RQ, SQ)$ can be mapped to four basis-like elements that multiply analogously to quaternion units, but with the essential projection properties intact.

      <h2>3. Fundamental Properties of the Quadruple Object</h2>
      
      <h3>3.1 Withdrawal as Noncommutativity (Commutator Properties)</h3>
      
      <div class="proposition">
        <strong>Proposition 1 (RO Noncommutativity -- Withdrawal)</strong>
        <p>
          Let $Q=(RO, SO, RQ, SQ)$ be a quadruple object in algebra $A$. Then for any element $X \in A$ that does <em>not</em> lie entirely in the commutant of $RO$, we have
          $$ [RO, X] \neq 0. $$
          In particular, 
          $$ [RO, SQ] \neq 0. $$
          Conversely, if $[RO, X] = 0$, then $X$ acts trivially on the hidden part of the object.

      <details class="collapsible">
        <summary>Proof</summary>
        <div class="proof">
          By Definition 1, $RO$ is chosen such that there exists a large set of elements in $A$ for which $[RO, Y] \neq 0$. In particular, since $SQ$ is defined to lie in $B$ and does not commute with $RO$, we have $[RO, SQ] \neq 0$. If, by contradiction, some nontrivial $X$ did satisfy $[RO, X]=0$, then $X$ would lie in the commutant of $RO$, contradicting the withdrawal property of $RO$. Thus, for any $X$ outside the centralizer of $RO$, $[RO, X] \neq 0$.

      <h3>3.2 Partial Overlap and Immanence</h3>
      
      <div class="proposition">
        <strong>Proposition 2 (Overlap Projection and Measurement)</strong>
        <p>
          For $Q=(RO, SO, RQ, SQ)$ in $A$, define 
          $$ P = RO\,SO. $$
          Then:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>$P$ is an idempotent projecting onto the overlap of the ranges of $RO$ and $SO$, i.e., $P^2 = P$.</li>
          <li>$\mathrm{Tr}(P)$ quantifies the dimension of the overlapping part of the real object visible in the sensual domain. In particular, $\mathrm{Tr}(P) = 0$ if and only if $P=0$ (no overlap).</li>
          <li>If $P=0$, then for any $SQ \in B$, $RO\,SQ = SQ\,RO = 0$, meaning no sensual qualities are associated with $RO$ in that context.</li>
          <li>If $P \neq 0$, then one can decompose 
            $$ RO = P + (RO-P) \quad \text{and} \quad SO = P + (SO-P), $$
            providing a breakdown of the real object into a part visible in $B$ and a part that is withdrawn.

          We have 
          $$ P^2 = (RO\,SO)(RO\,SO) = RO\,(SO\,RO)\,SO. $$
          Since $RO$ and $SO$ are idempotent projectors, $P$ projects onto the intersection of their ranges. The trace of $P$ is zero if and only if $P=0$, meaning there is no vector simultaneously in the range of $RO$ and $SO$. If $P=0$, then $RO$ does not appear in the subalgebra $B$ (on which $SO$ acts as identity), hence for any $SQ \in B$, $RO\,SQ = 0$. Conversely, if $P\neq 0$, the decomposition follows by linear algebra in $A$, splitting $RO$ (and similarly $SO$) into the component present in $B$ and the remainder.

      <h3>3.3 Invariance under UOR Transformations</h3>
      
      <div class="theorem">
        <strong>Theorem 1 (Structure Preservation under Algebra Automorphisms)</strong>
        <p>
          Let $Q = (RO,SO,RQ,SQ)$ be a quadruple object in $A$, and let $\Phi: A \to A$ be a $*$-algebra automorphism. Then the image 
          $$ Q' = \Phi(Q) := (\Phi(RO), \Phi(SO), \Phi(RQ), \Phi(SQ)) $$
          is also a valid quadruple object in $A$.

      </div>
      
      <details class="collapsible">
        <summary>Proof</summary>
        <div class="proof">
          Since $\Phi$ is a $*$-algebra automorphism, it preserves addition, multiplication, and the $*$-operation. Hence, for idempotents, 
          $$ \Phi(e)^2 = \Phi(e^2) = \Phi(e). $$
          Therefore, $\Phi(RO)$ and $\Phi(SO)$ are idempotents. Moreover, since commutators are preserved (i.e. $\Phi([X,Y]) = [\Phi(X),\Phi(Y)]$), the relationships such as $[RO,SQ]\neq 0$ are carried over to $[\Phi(RO),\Phi(SQ)] \neq 0$. Similarly, $\Phi(RQ)$ commutes with $\Phi(RO)$ because 
          $$ \Phi(RQ)\,\Phi(RO) = \Phi(RQ\,RO) = \Phi(RO\,RQ) = \Phi(RO)\,\Phi(RQ). $$
          Thus, the quadruple structure is maintained under $\Phi$, and $Q'$ satisfies the same properties as $Q$.
        </div>
      </details>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Corollary (Gauge Invariance):</strong> If the algebra $A$ has an internal symmetry group $G$ acting by automorphisms, then the classification of an element as $RO$, $SO$, $RQ$, or $SQ$ is gauge-covariant. A gauge transformation $g \in G$ sends 
        $$ Q=(RO,SO,RQ,SQ) \quad \text{to} \quad g \cdot Q = (g\cdot RO, g\cdot SO, g\cdot RQ, g\cdot SQ), $$
        which is again a quadruple object.

          The proof follows from the properties of idempotents and the trace. Since 
          $$ I_{2\leftarrow 1} = SO_2 \, RO_1 \, SO_2 $$
          projects onto the intersection of the range of $RO_1$ and the subspace defined by $SO_2$, its trace equals the dimension of this intersection. If $$ RO_1 \, SO_2=0, $$ then clearly $$ \mathrm{Tr}(I_{2\leftarrow 1})=0, $$ and similarly for the other direction. The statement regarding the commutators follows from the fact that even if $RO_1$ and $RO_2$ commute, nonzero commutators with $SO_2$ and $SO_1$, respectively, imply that the sensual domains do not fully capture the real essences, thus necessitating the presence of nontrivial overlap operators.

      <h2>5. Verification and Rigor of the Formalization</h2>
      <p>
        The formal definitions and proofs above align with a first-principles approach similar to that used in the UOR $H_1$ Hilbert–Pólya Operator Candidate formalization. Each component of the OOO quadruple has been rigorously defined using algebraic primitives, and each property has been proven using those definitions. This guarantees that there are no hidden assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, since the UOR framework is designed for mechanical verification, the entire development can be translated into a proof assistant (such as Coq or Isabelle) to verify every logical step. The definitions (idempotents, commutators, subalgebras) and propositions (regarding overlaps and invariance) can be encoded in the logical language of the proof assistant, ensuring that all operations (such as term-by-term multiplication or trace invariance) are rigorously checked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, the OOO Quadruple Object formalization presented here is self-contained, mathematically rigorous, and faithfully reflects the intended philosophical and structural content of OOO within the UOR framework.
      </p>

        <strong>Summary of Verified Properties:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stable Idempotents &amp; Noncommutativity:</strong> The real object $RO$ is a stable idempotent whose noncommutativity (i.e., $[RO,X] \neq 0$ for many $X\in A$) encodes its withdrawal. This property is invariant under algebra automorphisms.</li>
        <li><strong>Overlap (Partial Presence):</strong> The product $RO\,SO$ quantifies the portion of the real object visible in the sensual domain. Its trace serves as a measure of overlap.</li>
        <li><strong>Quaternionic/Clifford Structure:</strong> Although a pure quaternion algebra cannot host a nontrivial $RO$, an extended (matrix) quaternion algebra such as $M_2(\mathbb{C})$ can represent the quadruple object while preserving the required idempotent and noncommutativity properties.</li>
        <li><strong>Gauge Symmetry of Qualities:</strong> Real qualities $RQ$ are invariant under internal symmetries, while sensual qualities $SQ$ transform according to the context. This is preserved by automorphisms of $A$.</li>
        <li><strong>Interaction Mediation:</strong> Interactions between objects occur only through the overlap of their sensual projections, modeled by operators like $$ I_{2\leftarrow 1} = SO_2\,RO_1\,SO_2. $$ This mechanism captures the OOO idea that objects only interact through mediated, vicarious appearances.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each of these properties has been derived directly from the algebraic structure and can be mechanically verified, providing a robust foundation for further development of the UOR-based ontology.
